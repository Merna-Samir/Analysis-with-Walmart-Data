# Retail Analysis with Walmart Data

# Description 
Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of all, which are the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this assignment is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data. Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions are available.

• Store - the store number 

• Date - the week of sales

• Temperature - Temperature on the day of sale • Fuel_Price - Cost of fuel in the region 

• CPI – Prevailing consumer price index • Unemployment - Prevailing unemployment rate

# Tools and Libraries

We will be using the following tools and libraries for this project:

• Python Programming Language

• Jupyter Notebook

• Pandas Library for data manipulaon and analysis

• Seaborn Library for data visualizaon

• Matplotlib Library for data visualizaon

# Conclusion

Some holidays how they affect sales? . Find out which holidays have above-average non-holiday sales for all stores combined and so on.
